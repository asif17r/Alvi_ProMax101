# Alvi_ProMax101 Solutions Repository

This repository hosts C++ solutions by Alvi for a variety of programming problems. Each solution is organized by day and problem, and most files include both the problem statement and sample input/output for clarity.

## Structure
- **Day XX/**: Contains problems solved on a specific day **DURING CLASS**, with each file named according to the problem it solves.
- **Extra/**: Contains problems solved outside of class, following the naming convention `Day_<day_number>_<problem_name>.cpp`.

## What You'll Find
- Well-commented C++ solutions for each problem.
- Problem statements and sample test cases included at the top of each file.
- A clear folder structure for easy navigation and reference.

## Unsolved Problems
The following problems are in the `Unsolved` folder. Alvi, try to solve these soon!

- [Border_sum.cpp](Unsolved/Border_sum.cpp)
- [Diagonal_sum.cpp](Unsolved/Diagonal_sum.cpp)
- [Diamond_pattern.cpp](Unsolved/Diamond_pattern.cpp)
