# Extra Folder

This folder contains C++ solutions that Alvi solved outside the class. Each file follows the naming convention:

    Day_<day_number>_<problem_name>.cpp

## Naming Convention
- `Day_<day_number>_<problem_name>.cpp`
  - `<day_number>`: The day number when the problem was solved (e.g., 11 for Day 11).
  - `<problem_name>`: A short, descriptive name for the problem (e.g., sum_of_array).

## Example
- `Day_11_sum_of_array.cpp` â€” Solution for the sum of array problem solved on Day 11.
